#summary Explanation of 0.1.0

= Introduction =

Release 0.1.0 is basically just the release I wanted when I started this project.  It takes any IPD Blackberry dump and outputs a CSV formatted list of your SMS messages.

Please note that I'm not packaging up the source until I start hitting major releases.  You can easily access the subversion repository at [http://ippdump.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ http://ippdump.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/].
